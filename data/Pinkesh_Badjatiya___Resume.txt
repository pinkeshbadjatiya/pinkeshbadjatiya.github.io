Applied Scientist 2

Sept ’21 - Current (3 years)

Working with the PeopleAlsoAsk Team @Bing, STCI where I focus on Building, Productionizing and Scaling Machine
Learning systems for Bing users while maximizing DAU & User Experience, with Web-ready latency (<10ms).
Core Impact:
• Performed various LLMs Quantization & Optimization techniques to reduce latencies and increase throughputs.
• Proposed, Trained, Optimized & Distilled the Relevance Model, then quantized on FPGA architecture for <10ms latency. In production,
ONLY Relevance Model for PeopleAlsoAsk@Bing, Shipped with 100% Bing Coverage
• Productionized various Quality models – FPGA Relevance Model, Rel-Rank Model, QnA Generation Model (offline), Video QnA Generation,
Realtime QnA Retrieval – aggregating to Bing DAU gains of 0.1+%
• Shipped the ranker “Dynamic Ranker” – Improved engagement by 10+%, Provides quality data for all the LLM modelling efforts; Provides
50% of the online ranking signal; Shipped w/ 60% Bing Coverage
• Shipped new experience “Video QnA” – Created Model to generate QnA from Video content, Collaborated with IIT Madras, Shipped to
production w/ 2% Bing coverage
• Shipped new experience “Build Your Own Prompt” for Copilot on Bing – Manually Reformulated Queries reduced by -0.24%, Lowest
bad transfers % to Copilot, ensuring user-success, Filed a patent, Picked up by SEO Tabloids
• Built a real-time QnA Generation SLM Model ( 25ms @6 tok latency). Optimized model using distillation, quantization, architecture
pruning, and compression.
• Helped with the backend for other new experiences like Health QnA, QnA Rewrite, Relevance v2, etc.
• Top performer every year, Huge Impact on all KPIs – DAU, Coverage, Engagement, Experience etc.
Team Impact:
• Team Champ for POC & New Idea Execution from 0 to 1. Performed POCs for experiences like People Also Watch, Copilot on Whatsapp,
Copilot Quality for Indic Languages, etc..
• Leading a team of 2 applied scientists and 3 engineers, vested in their success.
• Additional Responsibilities include – Admin for STCI-wide GPU cluster, Regular talks as part of SLM v-Team etc..
• Internal talks – SLMs, Prompt Engineering, Modelling & Distillation, etc
• External talk & workshop – Prompt Engineering in AI Applications @TakeLessons, World of LLMs & Prompt Engineering @BITS GOA
• Mentored 3+ internship projects

### Pinkesh Badjatiya Bio ###
I am currently working as an Applied Scientist 2 with the Search Technology Center India (STCI) AI Products team at Microsoft (R&D) working on relevance and ranking systems for the PeopleAlsoAsk Experience. I work on large-scale NLP recommendation systems that show relevant questions to Bing users while maximizing user engagement & experience. I work on mining signals from massive interaction data at Bing scale, building large-scale ML models, utilizing Machine Learning to distill information, and deploying them with Web-ready latency (<10ms).

Prior to this, I worked with the Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) Lab - a BU embedded research group in Digital Marketing at Adobe as a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer 2, where I mainly focused on Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. Much of my research is in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and training Deep Neural Networks to solve complex social problems. I am also interested in bringing these recent developments in AI to production systems.

I finished my MS by Research in Machine Learning with a focus in the domain of Information Retrieval and Extraction (IRE) from IIIT Hyderabad under the guidance of Prof. Vasudeva Varma (former Dean R&D, IIIT Hyderabad) and Prof. Manish Gupta (Microsoft, India). My thesis was encompassing the realm of Hate Speech Detection and Bias Mitigation in neural networks. Insights from my research work subsequently resulted in the formation of Project ANGEL which later garnered the Google AI/ML Research Award 2020. Other projects I worked on during my studies include Trust Inference in Social Network, Document Segmentation, Text Summarization and Project Sexism. I also completed my B.Tech with Honours in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad.

I feel fortunate to have worked with some of the amazing folks from both Academia and Machine Learning Research. Just to thank a few folks; Manish Gupta, Georgios Theocharous, Balaji Krishnamurthy, Jayakumar Subramanian, Mausoom Sarkar, Niyati Chhaya, and Vasudeva Verma.

I spend most of my time reading books. I also spend my spare time pursuing my childhood passion; following Astronomy, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. Occasionally, I play Table Tennis (TT) and play piano (Youtube).
